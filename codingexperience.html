  <h1> -My coding experience-</h1>
<h3>I’ve been coding for about 1 or 2 years and I've explored several different languages and programs throughout my coding experience. 
  <h2> 7th grade programming class: </h2>
<h3>I started coding in 7th grade(?) with a programming class at school, we adventured all sorts of languages such as Python, HTML, and Javascript. Throughout the year we made games, and websites on programs such as CodeAvengers, and Ozaria. </h3>

  <h2> 8th/9th grade online coding classes: </h2>
<h3>For about 8 months now, I've been taking online coding classes each week. Similar to my 7th grade programming class we’ve adventured languages such as python, html, css and more. We’ve worked mainly on programs such as Scratch and Codepen, throughout the beginning of my online coding experience we explored more on Scratch. We dragged and dropped LOTS of different types of codes that were in categories (such as motion, looks, sounds, and sensing) which eventually led to a creation of some sort of game. Secondly, we used Codepen to make websites by self writing code using both HTML and CSS.  </h3>

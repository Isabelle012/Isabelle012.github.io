<h1>-About Me-</h1>
<h3>Hi! My name’s Isabelle or more specifically Isabelle Chung and I'm a 14 year old girl. My hobbies include: drawing, baking, cooking, and coding. During school my most enjoyed subject is suprisingly.... math. To me math makes the most sense so i enjoy it the most. Some more facts about me are that I speak both Korean and English, I play trombone, and my favorite color is blue! Oh also! My ultimate favorite dessert is either mint chocolate chip ice cream, boba or macarons! </h3>

<h1> -Personality-</h1>
<h3>
If I had to label myself with some positive character traits my top 3 would be:
  <h3> 1. Kind </h3> 
  <h3> 2. Caring </h3>
  <h3> 3. Independent </h3>
  <h2> MBTI: </h2>
<h3> My mbti that forever hasn’t changed is ISTP. I’m extremely introverted and shy and that has never changed throughout my life. One thing that also hasn’t changed is how I deal with the world (T vs F) rather than feeling/acknowledging my feelings, I always tend to think before doing anything. </h3>
